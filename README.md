# MVP -> MVVM

This project is a POC of migrate architectures from MVP to MVVM.
It's based on poked√©x using to show a list of pokemons and a detail of each one. It's quit simple but it implements all architecture layers so you can find data layer (repository and data sources), domain layer (usecases) and presentation layer (oresenter - view and view model - view).
You'll find 2 usecases, find pokemon list by pagination and find single pokemon by name.
